How to build from source (I only know if this works on Linux)

Open your terminal and type in the following commands:

1. "git clone https://github.com/sHacker927/Calculator"
2. "mkdir build"
3. "cd build"
4. "cmake .."
5. "make"
6. "sudo make install"

 The program should have installed and whenver you'd like to use it just open your terminal and type in "Calculator"
